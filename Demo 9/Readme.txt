:: This script creates two files "TestFile.txt" and "TestFile2.txt" in the file path C:\windows. It then copies them two files to the %TEMP% folder.
:: It attempts to copy the third then fails as it doesn't exist. It then deletes the original "TestFile.txt" from the original directory in "C:\windows"
