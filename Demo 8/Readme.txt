rem this script will check if two numbers equal 73. Sheldon Coopers favourite number!
:: if the numbers don't equal 73 the user can try again. This is an error tester for calculations.
rem you can add a variable for 73 such as a user requested number or another value, but I love the number 73 so I used that.
